As the final course project you will develop a web site using Ruby on Rails. The website should consist of 1 to 3 pages and involve interaction. It must include a database. The website should solve a problem, but should not try to solve all of the world's problems.

You will be using test-driven development and extreme programming techniques in project development. The details will be explained as the course proceeds. Once the implementation phase of the project has begun, you will have a weekly releases, each of which should add a small bit of functionality to the project. The weekly releases will be part of your grade. You will need to provide release notes along with each release, describing the functionality that was added during that release. You will be using version control and unit testing during your project's development.

You must include a technical report of 2 to 3 pages single spaced. The technical report should include (use these headings in your document so I can find things):

An overview of the purpose of the website.
A statement of your project's goal (three or four sentences).
A detailed description of the client side.
A detailed description of your backend and database.
A discussion of the challenges you faced and how you resolved them.
A discussion of the good points of your project.
A discussion of the weak points of your project.
A description of what you would do if you had three more weeks to work on the project.
If there are bugs, these should be described.
You will be asked for story boards and other items during the semester.

Presentation in the final:

Your presentation should be three minutes or so.
Emphasize the accomplishments and the weaknesses.
You will also have a link to your working site.
Be prepared for questions.
